                    Programming is core of computer science. Computer is a univeral machine
                    that can be programmed to do essentially any computation.
                    For a program to be useful we need to have a sequence
                    of coherent steps and the power of the computer is
                    to execute those steps quickly. The language that the
                    course teaches is Python.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> The reason why programming languages like Python exist
                    is because in natural languages like English or Mandarin
                    there's ambiguity that exists in the way its spoken
                    and also they're verbose, but when it comes to programming
                    languages a complicated task only requires few lines
                    of code and described in a sequence of steps. The programs
                    that are written in python, are executed by python
                    in a language the computer understands.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> An important construct in a Language is expressions,
                    an Expression is a statement which equates to a value.
                    If an expression does not follow the grammar rules
                    of the programming language then a syntax error is
                    thrown. The rules of a language is defined by grammar
                    and one such grammar notation is Backus Naur Form.
                    A grammar describes the language in a precise and concise
                    way.

                    A function or procedure is a set of steps executed as one entity. The objective
                    of having a function is to make the code less repetitive
                    and also modular. When a function is used it is passed
                    an input and gives out an output.

                    The inputs are called arguments or opernds. A function
                    is defined using the def keyword followed by a name
                    and a parenthesis '()'.

                    because rather than returning the greeting it is printing

                    procedures which do not return a value [1]. Modified

                    Giving programs the ability to make decisions and execute code based on
                    the output is very important. The comparision operators
                    in python give the ability to programs to make decisions.
                    Below are the comparision operators provided by python,
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    < - Less than, <br/> > - Greater than,

                    <=- Less than equal, <br/> >= - Greater than equal,
                    <br/> != - Not equal
                    <br/> Python also provides a way to execute code based on
                    test expressions. The block is executed only if the
                    text expression is True.

                        The while loop evaluates the block of code as long as the test expression
                        evaluates to True. The loop stops once the expression
                        is evaluated to False.
